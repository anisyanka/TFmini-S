/*
 * BEWARE !!!
 *
 * Conditions with Potential Malfunction:
 * 
 * 1. Detecting object with high reflectivity, such as the mirror or the smooth floor tile, may cause a system malfunction.
 * 2. The product will malfunction if there is any transparent object between it and the detecting object, such as glass or water.
 * 3. The product will be subject to risk of failure if its transmitting or receiving len is covered by the dust. Please keep the lens clean.
 * 4. Please do not directly touch circuit board of the product by hand as it is exposed.
 *    Please wear antistatic wrist strap or glove if necessary; Otherwise, the product will be subject to risk of failure,
 *    which is shown by failure of normal operation, and even it will be broken.
